   <h1>About Meghalaya</h1>
   <p>Carved from the erstwhile State of Assam, Meghalaya became a full fledged State on January 21,1972. Bounded on the North and East by Assam and on the South and West by Bangladesh, Meghalaya is spread over an area of 22,429 square kilometres, and lies between 20.1° N and 26.5° N latitude and 85.49 °E and 92.52 °E longitude.</p>
   <h3>Climate</h3>
   <p>The State enjoys a temperate climate. It is directly influenced by the South-West Monsoon and the northeast winter wind. The four seasons of Meghalaya are: Spring - March and April, Summer (Monsoon) - May to September, Autumn -October and November and Winter - December to February.</p>
   <p>The Monsoon usually starts by the third week of May and continues right to the end of September and sometimes well into the middle of October. Maximum rainfall occurs over the southern slopes of the Khasi Hills, i.e over the Sohra and the Mawsynram platform, which receives the heaviest rainfall in the world. The average rainfall in the State is 12,000 mm.</p>
   <h3>Rong’bang Waterfalls</h3>
   <p>Locally known as Rong’bang dare, this waterfall is situated 25 miles away from Tura on the Tura Williamnagar Road, a little beyong Rombagre village. It is a tributary of the Simsang River which can be seen from this road but the real beauty and magnitude of it can be experienced when one goes down to the place at the bottom of the waterfalls.</p>
   <p>This Sprightly fall, though perennial, is at its best during the monsoon months. It presents motorists driving from Asanangre towards Williamnagar, a romantic visual of lasting satisfaction. Although the fall is located about crow-flight kilometres away from the highway, the width and depth of the falls are enough to make it clearly visible and a sheer delight. Clustered on either side by vast evergreen hills of bamboo’s which sway, leaving the viewer with memories of ecstatic joy.</p>
   <h3>Krem Mawkhyrdop or Krem Mawmluh Caves</h3>
   <p>
    The main entrance of this famous cave is located at the bottom of the western flank of Lum Lawbah.
   </p>
   <p>The entrance is easily found by following the river behind the cement works of the Mawmluh Cherra Cements Limited, downstream for about 200 metres to a point where the river disappears underground.</p>
<p>The main sink entrance requires wading through water, which in the dry season turns into a deadly black quicksand from the effluents of the cements works. The best option to enter the cave would be through a high level bypass entrance which runs parallel to the main passage.</p>
<h3>Trekking</h3>
<p>Meghalaya provides the best nature trek through rain forests to the river front at the bottom of the valley, to living root bridges which are exclusive to Meghalaya in the entire world. The dry months from November to February throw open abundant trekking, camping and caving opportunities for the adventurous. The trekking opportunity in Meghalaya is outstanding for the fact that, the terrain is very challenging. You can hire guides to walk through the terrains of Meghalaya.</p>
<p>Some of the best Trekking Routes: Living Root Bridge, Kyllang Rock, David Scott Trail, Sohpet-bneng</p>
<p>One of the most popular trekking routes is the old mule track marked by David Scott, traditionally used by people to travel from Mawphlang to present day Bangladesh.</p>
<p>This entire picturesque route extends to a five days trek or can be divided into shorter treks, the most common being from Mawphlang to Lad Mawphlang, a one day trek (16 km).</p>
<p>This four hour walk takes you past clear streams, by waterfalls over rushing rivers, through meadows, jungles, valleys and also through a Khasi village on a hilltop.</p>
<p>Another interesting trek is from Cherrapunjee to Pynursula or Krang to Pynursula. This trek is hard as one has to walk deep into the valleys before climbing up to Pynursula. There are many Living Root bridges on this trek and the experience of life in the deep valleys, with no access to modern amenities is unforgettable. This trek can be undertaken with the help of guides or tour operators.</p>
<p>Another popular destination for trekking and rock climbing is the Kyllang rock at Mairang. the sub-divisional head-quarter, 12 kms from which, lies the imposing Kyllang rock. A massive dome shape of single rock of granite, rising to an elevation of about 5400 ft above sea level, it measures 1,000 fts. across in diameter. Kyllang rock lies 78 km from Shillong</p>

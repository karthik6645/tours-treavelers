    <h1>introduction to Mount Kailash</h1>
    <p>A trek to Mount Kailash offers a unique travel experience: spectacular landscapes, incredible culture, faithful pilgrims.</p>
    <p>Mount Kailash or Kang Rinpoche in Tibetan, is located in the remote far west of the Tibetan plateau, and has an elevation of 6,714 m (22,030 ft.). It rises from the Barkha plain, near Lake Manasarovar and a basin that gives life to four of the greatest Asian rivers: Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra River), Karnali (a major tributary of the Ganges River), Sutlej River and Indus River.</p>
<p>Mount Kailash is a sacred mountain in four religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and the followers of the indigenous Tibetan religion of Bön. For Hindus, Mount Kailash is the home of Shiva, the Destroyer and Transformer, and his consort Parvati. To Buddhists, Mt Kailash is the abode of Demchok and his consort Dorje Phagmo, it is also believed that Mount Kailash is a natural mandala representing the Buddhist cosmology on the Earth.</p>
<P>The Jains believe this is the place where their religion’s founder was spiritually awakened, and Bonpos believe Mount Kailash to be the place where the founder of the Bon religion landed when he descended from the Heaven.</P>
<p>Lake Manasarovar (or Mapham Yum-tso in Tibetan) means the “eternal and invincible jade lake”, and lies only 32 km southeast of Mount Kailash, with an altitude of 4,560m (14,960 ft.). The lake covers an area of 412 square km, and it is the highest freshwater lake in the world.</p>
<p>Lake Manasarovar is one of the three holy lakes in Tibet by followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and local Tibetan religion of Bön. A lot of Hindu pilgrim groups will take a bath at Lake Manasarovar after the devote Mount Kailash Kora (the famous pilgrimage) to clear away the sins.</p>
<h3>How to get to Mount Kailash</h3>
<p>The first question you shall ask yourself is where and how you would like to enter Tibet? From Mainland China, or Kathmandu, in Nepal?</p>
<p>First, the only international flight that arrives in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, departs from Kathmandu, in Nepal. So, if you’re considering to take the flight to Tibet, then you need to transit from one city in Mainland China or get to Kathmandu, and fly from there to Tibet.</p>
<p>There are trains and direct flights available from some big cities in Mainland China such as Beijing, Xi’an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Shanghai, and others, to Lhasa.</p>
<p>There are also daily flights operated from Kathmandu to Lhasa. Land travel by crossing the border from Nepal to Tibet is also possible now, as the border Kyirong was just opened to foreign passport holders a few months ago.</p>
<p>Once you decided how to enter Tibet, then the next question will be how to travel to Mount Kailash.</p>
<h3>The best time to visit Mount Kailash</h3>
<p>The best time for a Kailash tour/trekking is from mid-May to mid-October. However, snow could be encountered on the Drolma-la pass at any time of year. The temperature will often drop well below freezing at night, even during the summer months.</p>
<p>While some die-hard travels may try to do the Kora when the passes are covered in snow, I won’t suggest it. Until early May, the pass tends to be snowed. If you just want to have an overland travel to Mount Kailash and other sites in far west of Tibet excluding the Kailash Kora, then you can consider to travel also in April or November.</p>
<p>A great time to meet the pilgrims at Kailash Kora is from June to September, during the Hindu pilgrims season</p>
<h3>Mount Kailash pilgrimage (Kailash Kora)</h3>
<p>The circuit (or Kora) of Mount Kailash is one of the most important pilgrimages in Asia. Buddhists believe that circumambulating Mount Kailash will wash away the sins (bad karma) of a lifetime and offre protection against evil spirits. It is said that a 13 times circuit around Mount Kailash will bring enlightenment within one lifetime, and 108 revolutions will bring instant enlightenment.</p>
<p>Kailash Trek (or Kailash Kora) is long 52 km, it starts from the village Darchen (4,675 m / 15,340 ft.), it crosses a plain, then head up a wide river valley, climb up and over the 5,630 m / 18,470 ft. Drolma-la Pass, head down another river valley, and finally cross the original plain to Darchen. The circuit is a straightforward natural circuit and easy for travelers to follow up. Hindus, Jains and Buddhists go clockwise while the followers of Bon go anticlockwise.</p>
<h3>Accomodation at Mount Kailash</h3>
<p>The accommodation condition has been improved in West Tibet in the past years, due to more travelers demands, however it is still quite basic compared to larger cities. In Saga, Darchen, Zanda and Ali you can find local 3/4 star hotels, which provide rooms with private bathroom and hot shower, but at the village near Lake Manasarovar and the ones that you will encounter while crossing the Northern Tibetan Changthang plateau, expect only dormitory bed available at the local guest houses</p>
<p>The lodging during the Kailash Kora will probably be a camping or a monastery guest house.</p>
